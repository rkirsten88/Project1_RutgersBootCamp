# Project1 - RutgersBootCamp - Star Wars Data Analysis
## Robert Kirsten
Goal: To break down the first 6 movies using Star Wars API data. 

Hypothesis: Can creativity be quantified? Can the size and shapes of characters, places, and things tell us anything about the creative process? 

Who is the biggest character in Star Wars? Just how big IS the Death Star compared to the rest of the Star Wars Universe? 

What characters get the most screen time?
